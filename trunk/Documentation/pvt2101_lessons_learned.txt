Lessons learned


- The hardest part is finalizing the set of language features that you want in a program.

- When working in a group designing something complex like a language, a huge bulk of the time will be spent discussing and changing things that you had decided on earlier.

- It is important to try to implement the fundamental features of the language early on so you know what to keep and what to tweak.

- Expect to have to deal with many unexpected situations that come up only when doing the development and implementation phase.
